Response to emotional pressure suffered for a prolonged period of time

* overworked
* unrealistic deadlines
* multitasking
* arguments at home

--

### Chronic stress effects

* stronger amygdala - more fear
* weaker hypocampus - less learning and memory
* shrinking of prefrontal cortex - less cognitive ability
  * loss of synaptic connections between neurons

## Synaptic connections

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mItV4rC57kM),
[Alt video](../videos/synapses.mp4)

* neurons 1 or 0
* synapses
  * sender signal 0..1
  * receiver sensitivity 0..1

  * the more you think/feel/do it, the more you think/feel/do it
  * obsessive
* builds new roads
  * resistant to change
  * no fixed personality
* breaks abandoned roads
  * can get rid of any habbit
  * important to constantly stimulate different paths

---

## Ways to break thoughts cycle

* alcohol
  * screws up synapses, kills neurons
* sports
  * requires special setup
* meditation
  * hard to learn

--

### Concentrate on one thing

* do something that requires concentration
* notice that you are thinking about something else
  * I am thinking about work
* get back to concentration object
  * Where was I? ...
* no push
  * fighting the thoughts is thinking those thoughts
  * just do something more important

---

## Forming habits

![habits](../images/forming-habits.png)

---

### Changing reactions

* everything that happens in the brain is real
* after you noticed that things went wrong
  * understand where you started to go off the path
  * identify exact trigger
  * think of what you wish you have done
  * live it up in your brain
    * feel the trigger
    * do the right thing
* iterate on failure
